1.	Which of the followings is considered boxing?
    c. object myobjx = fx;

2.	Which of the followings is considered unboxing?
    d. int ix = (int) objy;

3.	Object objdblx is of type double. Assign the value of this object to a variable of type float.
      float fx = objdblx; (Stuck) I think I need to unbox and then cast

4.	Object objflx is of type float. Assign the value of this object o another variable of type double.
      double dx = objflx; (Stuck) I think I need to unbox and then cast

5.	Convert the string strx to a double dblx:
      string strx = x;//cast1
      double dblx = double.Parse(strx); //cast2
      double dblX = srtx; 
      
6.	Convert the integer ix to a float fx:
      Integer intx = ix;
      float fx = (float)ix;
      float fx = ifx

7.	Convert the double dblx to a string strx:
    Double dblx = x
    string strx = string.parse(dblx);
    string strx = dblx
      
8.	Object is the   ultimate base class_ of all other data types.

9.	What is an object (the definition)? Object by itself is a type and mother of all types. 
    Anything which has some properties and can perform some function is an object. An object effectively consists of: 
      	Fields (the state)
      	A type reference (can never change through the lifetime of the object)
      	A monitor (for synchronization)

10.	  How do you declare an object in C#?
            object myObj = x;
    What is the difference between an object and a variable? 
    Object by itself is a type and mother of all types and a variable is just a storage container for a given type.
